Wolfram Blockchain Labs (WBL) is the five-year-old subsidiary of the 36-year-old Wolfram Research that is exclusively licensed with high-performance Wolfram blockchain technologies and specifically designed to extend ecosystem tools for application development for distributed ledger technologies (DLTs).  
WBL provides four distinct areas of ecosystem support for DLTs: computational intelligence for blockchain-based smart contracts, direct access to blockchain data through blockchain integrations, blockchain educational programs and crypto asset analytical tools.  
â€‹WBL often uses additional expertise in specialized areas like machine learning from both Wolfram Research and Wolfram Technical Consulting. The latter is an organization that has completed over three hundred consulting projects in the past decade.
